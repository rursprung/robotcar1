# Introduction
This is the documentation for the toy RC robot car developed by me as part of the first mobile robotics project
(a 3rd semester module) of the [BSc in Mobile Robotics at FHGR](https://fhgr.ch/mr).

Note that this was implemented in a (somewhat) time-boxed manner, accordingly not everything is implemented or working as it should.

This documentation is in addition to the in-code documentation, not a replacement thereof. For implementation details
and refer to the source code and its inline documentation.
