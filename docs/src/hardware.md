# Hardware
The robotcar is a small RC toy car based on the [YFRobot Steering Gear Robot](https://yfrobot.com/collections/robot-kits/products/steering-gear-robot).
All electronic modules are mounted to the PCB, which in turn is mounted on the main car using stilts.

The battery module fits in nicely between the frame of the car and the Nucleo board (hanging under the PCB) and the servo
and the main engine. Due to the rear stilts it has to be inserted at just the right angle, but once in it is held in place
by the stilts, servo and engine. Thus, no external battery holder has been added.

A rear-mounted battery holder has been designed, but this would've had the downside of having all the weight at the rear,
leading to a bad weight-balance of the car and resulting in deteriorated steering performance.
