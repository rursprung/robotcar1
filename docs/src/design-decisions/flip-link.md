# Stack Overflow Protection
[`flip-link`](https://crates.io/crates/flip-link) flips the memory layout of embedded programs to protect against stack overflows.
It has been added to this project because it's best practices to have it enabled, as it helps track down stack overflows.

See the `flip-link` documentation for a more detailed explanation of how it works (incl. nice graphics!).
